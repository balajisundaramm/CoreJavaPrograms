/*
This is slightly more difficult version of the famous FizzBuzz problem
which is sometimes given as a first problem for job interviews.
Consider the series of numbers beginning at start and running up to
but not including end, so for example start=1 and end=5 gives
the series 1, 2, 3, 4. Return a new String[] array containing the string
 form of these numbers, except for multiples of 3, use "Fizz" instead of
 the number, for multiples of 5 use "Buzz", and for multiples of both 3 and 5
  use "FizzBuzz". In Java, String.valueOf(xxx) will make
  the String form of an int or other type. This version is a little more
  complicated than the usual version since you have to th:src="@{ocate and
  index into an array instead of just printing, and we vary the
  start/end instead of just always doing 1..100.
